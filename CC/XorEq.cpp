/*
For a given N, find the number of ways to choose an integer x from the range [0,2N−1] such that x⊕(x+1)=(x+2)⊕(x+3), where ⊕

denotes the bitwise XOR operator.

Since the number of valid x
can be large, output it modulo 109+7

.
Input

    The first line contains an integer T

, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The only line of each test case contains a single integer N

    .

Output

For each test case, output in a single line the answer to the problem modulo 109+7

.
Constraints

    1≤T≤105

1≤N≤105
