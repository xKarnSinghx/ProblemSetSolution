/*
You have two binary strings A and B, both of length N. You have to merge both the binary strings to form a new binary string C of length 2⋅N. The relative order of characters in the original binary strings A and B should not change in the binary string C

.

For example, if A=01011
and B=10100, one possible way to merge them to form C is: C=0101101100

.

Minimize the number of inversions in the merged binary string C

.

As a reminder, a pair of indices (i,j)
is an inversion for binary string C if and only if 1≤i<j≤|C|, Ci=1 and Cj=0

.
Input Format

    The first line of input contains a single integer T

, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T
test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N
— the length of the binary strings A and B
.
The second line of each test case contains the binary string A
.
The third line of each test case contains the binary string B

    .

Output Format

For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum number of inversions in the merged binary string C

.
Constraints

    1≤T≤1000

1≤N≤1000
It is guaranteed that the sum of N
over all test cases does not exceed 2000
.
|A|=|B|=N
A
and B are binary strings, i.e, contain only 0 and 1

    .

Explanation

Test Case 1
: A=1010 and B=0101. One optimal C is 01010101. The 6 inversions in this C are {(2,3),(2,5),(2,7),(4,5),(4,7),(6,7)}

.

Test Case 2
: A=10010 and B=11001. One optimal C is 1001100101

.

Test Case 3
: A=00001 and B=11110. One optimal C is 0000111101.
