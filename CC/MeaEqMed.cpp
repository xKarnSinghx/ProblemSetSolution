/*
Chef gets confused between mean and median very often, and as a result, he has developed a dislike of arrays whose mean and median are not equal.

Chef has an array A of N elements. He can perform the following operation on it:

Pick an index 1≤i≤N and increase Ai by 1.
He would like to obtain an array whose mean and median are equal. Determine the minimum number of operations required to achieve this.

Note: The median of an array A of length N is defined as follows: Sort the array A. Then,

If N is even, the median is the (N2)th element
If N is odd, the median is the (N+12)th element
For example, the median of the array [3,4,1,2] is 2 and the median of the array [3,4,1] is 3.

Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of testcases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, denoting the size of the array.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the minimum number of operations Chef needs to perform to make the mean and median equal.

Constraints
1≤T≤104
2≤N≤3⋅105
1≤Ai≤109
Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅105

Explanation
Test Case 1: The mean and median of the array are both 2. They are already equal, so no operations are required.

Test Case 2: It is optimal to apply the operation on 1st and 2nd index twice each. The array after applying these operations will be [3,3,3,3], which has both mean and median 3.
