Ashish has n elements arranged in a line.

These elements are represented by two integers ai — the value of the element and bi — the type of the element (there are only two possible types: 0 and 1). He wants to sort the elements in non-decreasing values of ai.

He can perform the following operation any number of times:

Select any two elements i and j such that bi≠bj and swap them. That is, he can only swap two elements of different types in one move.
Tell him if he can sort the elements in non-decreasing values of ai after performing any number of operations.

Input
The first line contains one integer t (1≤t≤100) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (1≤n≤500) — the size of the arrays.

The second line contains n integers ai (1≤ai≤105)  — the value of the i-th element.

The third line containts n integers bi (bi∈{0,1})  — the type of the i-th element.

Output
For each test case, print "Yes" or "No" (without quotes) depending on whether it is possible to sort elements in non-decreasing order of their value.

You may print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Note
For the first case: The elements are already in sorted order.

For the second case: Ashish may first swap elements at positions 1 and 2, then swap elements at positions 2 and 3.

For the third case: The elements are already in sorted order.

For the fourth case: No swap operations may be performed as there is no pair of elements i and j such that bi≠bj. The elements cannot be sorted.

For the fifth case: Ashish may swap elements at positions 3 and 4, then elements at positions 1 and 2.
