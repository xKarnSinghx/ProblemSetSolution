Let's call a list of positive integers a0,a1,...,an−1 a power sequence if there is a positive integer c, so that for every 0≤i≤n−1 then ai=ci.

Given a list of n positive integers a0,a1,...,an−1, you are allowed to:

Reorder the list (i.e. pick a permutation p of {0,1,...,n−1} and change ai to api), then
Do the following operation any number of times: pick an index i and change ai to ai−1 or ai+1 (i.e. increment or decrement ai by 1) with a cost of 1.
Find the minimum cost to transform a0,a1,...,an−1 into a power sequence.

Input
The first line contains an integer n (3≤n≤105).

The second line contains n integers a0,a1,...,an−1 (1≤ai≤109).

Output
Print the minimum cost to transform a0,a1,...,an−1 into a power sequence.

Note
In the first example, we first reorder {1,3,2} into {1,2,3}, then increment a2 to 4 with cost 1 to get a power sequence {1,2,4}.
