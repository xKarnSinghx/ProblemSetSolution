Suppose you have two points p=(xp,yp) and q=(xq,yq). Let's denote the Manhattan distance between them as d(p,q)=|xp−xq|+|yp−yq|.

Let's say that three points p, q, r form a bad triple if d(p,r)=d(p,q)+d(q,r).

Let's say that an array b1,b2,…,bm is good if it is impossible to choose three distinct indices i, j, k such that the points (bi,i), (bj,j) and (bk,k) form a bad triple.

You are given an array a1,a2,…,an. Calculate the number of good subarrays of a. A subarray of the array a is the array al,al+1,…,ar for some 1≤l≤r≤n.

Note that, according to the definition, subarrays of length 1 and 2 are good.

Input
The first line contains one integer t (1≤t≤5000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105) — the length of array a.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤109).

It's guaranteed that the sum of n doesn't exceed 2⋅105.

Output
For each test case, print the number of good subarrays of array a.

Note
In the first test case, it can be proven that any subarray of a is good. For example, subarray [a2,a3,a4] is good since it contains only three elements and:

d((a2,2),(a4,4))=|4−3|+|2−4|=3 < d((a2,2),(a3,3))+d((a3,3),(a4,4))=3+1+2+1=7;
d((a2,2),(a3,3)) < d((a2,2),(a4,4))+d((a4,4),(a3,3));
d((a3,3),(a4,4)) < d((a3,3),(a2,2))+d((a2,2),(a4,4));
In the second test case, for example, subarray [a1,a2,a3,a4] is not good, since it contains a bad triple (a1,1), (a2,2), (a4,4):

d((a1,1),(a4,4))=|6−9|+|1−4|=6;
d((a1,1),(a2,2))=|6−9|+|1−2|=4;
d((a2,2),(a4,4))=|9−9|+|2−4|=2;
So, d((a1,1),(a4,4))=d((a1,1),(a2,2))+d((a2,2),(a4,4)).
