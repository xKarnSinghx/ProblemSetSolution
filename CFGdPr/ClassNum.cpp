Let's call some positive integer classy if its decimal representation contains no more than 3 non-zero digits. For example, numbers 4, 200000, 10203 are classy and numbers 4231, 102306, 7277420000 are not.

You are given a segment [L;R]. Count the number of classy integers x such that L≤x≤R.

Each testcase contains several segments, for each of them you are required to solve the problem separately.

Input
The first line contains a single integer T (1≤T≤104) — the number of segments in a testcase.

Each of the next T lines contains two integers Li and Ri (1≤Li≤Ri≤1018).

Output
Print T lines — the i-th line should contain the number of classy integers on a segment [Li;Ri].
