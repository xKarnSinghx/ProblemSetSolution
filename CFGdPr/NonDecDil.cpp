Alice has recently received an array a1,a2,…,an for her birthday! She is very proud of her array, and when she showed her friend Bob the array, he was very happy with her present too!

However, soon Bob became curious, and as any sane friend would do, asked Alice to perform q operations of two types on her array:

1 x y: update the element ax to y (set ax=y).
2 l r: calculate how many non-decreasing subarrays exist within the subarray [al,al+1,…,ar]. More formally, count the number of pairs of integers (p,q) such that l≤p≤q≤r and ap≤ap+1≤⋯≤aq−1≤aq.
Help Alice answer Bob's queries!

Input
The first line contains two integers n and q (1≤n,q≤2⋅105) — the size of the array, and the number of queries, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤109) — the elements of Alice's array.

The next q lines consist of three integers each. The first integer of the i-th line is ti, the operation being performed on the i-th step (ti=1 or ti=2).

If ti=1, the next two integers are xi and yi (1≤xi≤n; 1≤yi≤109), updating the element at position xi to yi (setting axi=yi).

If ti=2, the next two integers are li and ri (1≤li≤ri≤n), the two indices Bob asks Alice about for the i-th query.

It's guaranteed that there is at least one operation of the second type.

Output
For each query of type 2, print a single integer, the answer to the query.

Note
For the first query, l=2 and r=5, and the non-decreasing subarrays [p,q] are [2,2], [3,3], [4,4], [5,5], [2,3] and [4,5].
