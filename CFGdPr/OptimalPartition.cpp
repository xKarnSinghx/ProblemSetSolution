You are given an array a consisting of n integers. You should divide a into continuous non-empty subarrays (there are 2n−1 ways to do that).

Let s=al+al+1+…+ar. The value of a subarray al,al+1,…,ar is:

(r−l+1) if s>0,
0 if s=0,
−(r−l+1) if s<0.
What is the maximum sum of values you can get with a partition?
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤5⋅105) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤5⋅105).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (−109≤ai≤109).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5⋅105.

Output
For each test case print a single integer — the maximum sum of values you can get with an optimal parition.

Note
Test case 1: one optimal partition is [1,2], [−3]. 1+2>0 so the value of [1,2] is 2. −3<0, so the value of [−3] is −1. 2+(−1)=1.

Test case 2: the optimal partition is [0,−2,3], [−4], and the sum of values is 3+(−1)=2.
