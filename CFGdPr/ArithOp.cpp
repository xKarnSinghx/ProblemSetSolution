You are given an array of integers a1,a2,…,an.

You can do the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):

Choose any index i and set ai to any integer (positive, negative or 0).
What is the minimum number of operations needed to turn a into an arithmetic progression? The array a is an arithmetic progression if ai+1−ai=ai−ai−1 for any 2≤i≤n−1.

Input
The first line contains a single integer n (1≤n≤105).

The second line contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤105).

Output
Print a single integer: the minimum number of operations needed to turn a into an arithmetic progression.

Note
In the first test, you can get the array a=[11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3] by performing 6 operations:

Set a3 to 9: the array becomes [3,2,9,8,6,9,5,4,1];
Set a2 to 10: the array becomes [3,10,9,8,6,9,5,4,1];
Set a6 to 6: the array becomes [3,10,9,8,6,6,5,4,1];
Set a9 to 3: the array becomes [3,10,9,8,6,6,5,4,3];
Set a5 to 7: the array becomes [3,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3];
Set a1 to 11: the array becomes [11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3].
a is an arithmetic progression: in fact, ai+1−ai=ai−ai−1=−1 for any 2≤i≤n−1.

There is no sequence of less than 6 operations that makes a an arithmetic progression.

In the second test, you can get the array a=[−1,2,5,8,11,14,17,20,23,26,29,32,35,38] by performing 10 operations.

In the third test, you can get the array a=[100000,80000,60000,40000,20000,0,−20000,−40000,−60000,−80000] by performing 7 operations.
