You have an array of integers a of size n. Initially, all elements of the array are equal to 1. You can perform the following operation: choose two integers i (1≤i≤n) and x (x>0), and then increase the value of ai by ⌊aix⌋ (i.e. make ai=ai+⌊aix⌋).

After performing all operations, you will receive ci coins for all such i that ai=bi.

Your task is to determine the maximum number of coins that you can receive by performing no more than k operations.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤100) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1≤n≤103;0≤k≤106) — the size of the array and the maximum number of operations, respectively.

The second line contains n integers b1,b2,…,bn (1≤bi≤103).

The third line contains n integers c1,c2,…,cn (1≤ci≤106).

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 103.

Output
For each test case, print one integer — the maximum number of coins that you can get by performing no more than k operations.
