You have an array a1,a2,…,an. Each element initially has value 0 and color 1. You are also given q queries to perform:

Color l r c: Change the color of elements al,al+1,⋯,ar to c (1≤l≤r≤n, 1≤c≤n).
Add c x: Add x to values of all elements ai (1≤i≤n) of color c (1≤c≤n, −109≤x≤109).
Query i: Print ai (1≤i≤n).
Input
The first line of input contains two integers n and q (1≤n,q≤106) — the length of array a and the number of queries you have to perform.

Each of the next q lines contains the query given in the form described in the problem statement.

Output
Print the answers to the queries of the third type on separate lines.
