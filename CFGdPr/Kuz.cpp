Kuzya started going to school. He was given math homework in which he was given an array a of length n and an array of symbols b of length n, consisting of symbols '*' and '/'.

Let's denote a path of calculations for a segment [l;r] (1≤l≤r≤n) in the following way:

Let x=1 initially. For every i from l to r we will consequently do the following: if bi= '*', x=x∗ai, and if bi= '/', then x=xai. Let's call a path of calculations for the segment [l;r] a list of all x that we got during the calculations (the number of them is exactly r−l+1).
For example, let a=[7, 12, 3, 5, 4, 10, 9], b=[/, ∗, /, /, /, ∗, ∗], l=2, r=6, then the path of calculations for that segment is [12, 4, 0.8, 0.2, 2].

Let's call a segment [l;r] simple if the path of calculations for it contains only integer numbers.

Kuzya needs to find the number of simple segments [l;r] (1≤l≤r≤n). Since he obviously has no time and no interest to do the calculations for each option, he asked you to write a program to get to find that number!

Input
The first line contains a single integer n (2≤n≤106).

The second line contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤106).

The third line contains n symbols without spaces between them — the array b1,b2…bn (bi= '/' or bi= '*' for every 1≤i≤n).

Output
Print a single integer — the number of simple segments [l;r].
