We are given a rooted tree consisting of n vertices numbered from 1 to n. The root of the tree is the vertex 1 and the parent of the vertex v is pv.

There is a number written on each vertex, initially all numbers are equal to 0. Let's denote the number written on the vertex v as av.

For each v, we want av to be between lv and rv (lv≤av≤rv).

In a single operation we do the following:

Choose some vertex v. Let b1,b2,…,bk be vertices on the path from the vertex 1 to vertex v (meaning b1=1, bk=v and bi=pbi+1).
Choose a non-decreasing array c of length k of nonnegative integers: 0≤c1≤c2≤…≤ck.
For each i (1≤i≤k), increase abi by ci.
What's the minimum number of operations needed to achieve our goal?

Input
The first line contains an integer t (1≤t≤1000)  — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2≤n≤2⋅105)  — the number of the vertices in the tree.

The second line of each test case contains n−1 integers, p2,p3,…,pn (1≤pi<i), where pi denotes the parent of the vertex i.

The i-th of the following n lines contains two integers li and ri (1≤li≤ri≤109).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅105.

Output
For each test case output the minimum number of operations needed.

Note
In the first test case, we can achieve the goal with a single operation: choose v=2 and c=[1,2], resulting in a1=1,a2=2.

In the second test case, we can achieve the goal with two operations: first, choose v=2 and c=[3,3], resulting in a1=3,a2=3,a3=0. Then, choose v=3,c=[2,7], resulting in a1=5,a2=3,a3=7.
