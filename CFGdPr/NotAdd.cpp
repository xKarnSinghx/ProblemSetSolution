You have an array a1,a2,…,an consisting of n distinct integers. You are allowed to perform the following operation on it:

Choose two elements from the array ai and aj (i≠j) such that gcd(ai,aj) is not present in the array, and add gcd(ai,aj) to the end of the array. Here gcd(x,y) denotes greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers x and y.
Note that the array changes after each operation, and the subsequent operations are performed on the new array.

What is the maximum number of times you can perform the operation on the array?

Input
The first line consists of a single integer n (2≤n≤106).

The second line consists of n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤106). All ai are distinct.

Output
Output a single line containing one integer — the maximum number of times the operation can be performed on the given array.

Note
In the first example, one of the ways to perform maximum number of operations on the array is:

Pick i=1,j=5 and add gcd(a1,a5)=gcd(4,30)=2 to the array.
Pick i=2,j=4 and add gcd(a2,a4)=gcd(20,25)=5 to the array.
Pick i=2,j=5 and add gcd(a2,a5)=gcd(20,30)=10 to the array.
It can be proved that there is no way to perform more than 3 operations on the original array.

In the second example one can add 3, then 1, then 5, and 2.
