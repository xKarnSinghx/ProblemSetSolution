The cuteness of a binary string is the number of 1s divided by the length of the string. For example, the cuteness of 01101 is 35.

Juju has a binary string s of length n. She wants to choose some non-intersecting subsegments of s such that their concatenation has length m and it has the same cuteness as the string s.

More specifically, she wants to find two arrays l and r of equal length k such that 1≤l1≤r1<l2≤r2<…<lk≤rk≤n, and also:

∑i=1k(ri−li+1)=m;
The cuteness of s[l1,r1]+s[l2,r2]+…+s[lk,rk] is equal to the cuteness of s, where s[x,y] denotes the subsegment sxsx+1…sy, and + denotes string concatenation.
Juju does not like splitting the string into many parts, so she also wants to minimize the value of k. Find the minimum value of k such that there exist l and r that satisfy the constraints above or determine that it is impossible to find such l and r for any k.

Input
The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1≤m≤n≤2⋅105).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string s of length n.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

Output
For each test case, if there is no valid pair of l and r, print −1.

Otherwise, print k+1 lines.

In the first line, print a number k (1≤k≤m) — the minimum number of subsegments required.

Then print k lines, the i-th should contain li and ri (1≤li≤ri≤n) — the range of the i-th subsegment. Note that you should output the subsegments such that the inequality l1≤r1<l2≤r2<…<lk≤rk is true.

Note
In the first example, the cuteness of 0011 is the same as the cuteness of 01.

In the second example, the cuteness of 11000011 is 12 and there is no subsegment of size 6 with the same cuteness. So we must use 2 disjoint subsegments 10 and 0011.

In the third example, there are 8 ways to split the string such that ∑i=1k(ri−li+1)=3 but none of them has the same cuteness as 0101.

In the last example, we don't have to split the string.
