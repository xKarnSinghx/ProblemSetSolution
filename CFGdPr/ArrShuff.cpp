oolimry has an array a of length n which he really likes. Today, you have changed his array to b, a permutation of a, to make him sad.

Because oolimry is only a duck, he can only perform the following operation to restore his array:

Choose two integers i,j such that 1≤i,j≤n.
Swap bi and bj.
The sadness of the array b is the minimum number of operations needed to transform b into a.

Given the array a, find any array b which is a permutation of a that has the maximum sadness over all permutations of the array a.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤104)  — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105)  — the length of the array.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤n)  — elements of the array a.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

Output
For each test case, print n integers b1,b2,…,bn — describing the array b. If there are multiple answers, you may print any.

Note
In the first test case, the array [1,2] has sadness 1. We can transform [1,2] into [2,1] using one operation with (i,j)=(1,2).

In the second test case, the array [3,3,2,1] has sadness 2. We can transform [3,3,2,1] into [1,2,3,3] with two operations with (i,j)=(1,4) and (i,j)=(2,3) respectively.
