You are given two arrays a and b, both of length n.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): select an index i (1≤i≤n) and swap ai and bi.

Let's define the cost of the array a as ∑ni=1∑nj=i+1(ai+aj)2. Similarly, the cost of the array b is ∑ni=1∑nj=i+1(bi+bj)2.

Your task is to minimize the total cost of two arrays.

Input
Each test case consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤40) — the number of test cases. The following is a description of the input data sets.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1≤n≤100) — the length of both arrays.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤100) — elements of the first array.

The third line of each test case contains n integers b1,b2,…,bn (1≤bi≤100) — elements of the second array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 100.

Output
For each test case, print the minimum possible total cost.

Note
In the second test case, in one of the optimal answers after all operations a=[2,6,4,6], b=[3,7,6,1].

The cost of the array a equals to (2+6)2+(2+4)2+(2+6)2+(6+4)2+(6+6)2+(4+6)2=508.

The cost of the array b equals to (3+7)2+(3+6)2+(3+1)2+(7+6)2+(7+1)2+(6+1)2=479.

The total cost of two arrays equals to 508+479=987.
